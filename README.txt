Plone 5.0a2: Unified Installer
==============================

The Plone Unified Installer is a source-installation kit that installs Plone
and its dependencies from source on most Unix-like platforms. The kit includes
Plone and Zope and will download components like Python if needed. Python is
installed in a way that will not change or interfere with your system Python.

**Important: Back up your existing Plone site prior to running the installer
or running buildout to update.**
