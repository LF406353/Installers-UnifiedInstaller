- include boostrap.py -- it will help when an install is moved.

- use "sudo -u user command" inside plonectl when installed in root mode.

- For root mode, create both a "zeo" and "plone" user for cluster. Run
zeoserver under zeo. Restructure var so that clients and server only own
what they need. clients don't need to own filestorage! All they need is a place
to write their logs, socket and pid.

- zc.buildout needs to go into python's site-packages, or it won't be possible
to run bootstrap.py after paster.

- The instance creation scripts always should have been python scripts;
using Python will be much easier than using sed for all the buildout.cfg
adaptations. It might also make it easier to reconcile the UnifiedInstaller
with Windows.
