4.0.10 2011-10-15

    - Update to 4.0.10

    - Earlier debian multiarch detection code would fail if multiple multiarch
      directories were present. Fixed, thanks to jgrigera for the solution.
      issue #12188

4.0.9 2011-07-29
    - Update to 4.0.9

    - Adapt for OS X 10.7. Mainly involved updates of readline and libjpeg.

4.0.8 2011-07-18
    - Update to 4.0.8

4.0.7 2011-06-30
    - Add Products.Zope-Hotfix-20110622 = 1.0
    
    - Update to Python 2.6.7

4.0.7 2011-06-19
    - Multiarch patch looked for the patch file in the wrong directory.

4.0.7
    - Add patch for Natty's multiarch. Fixes problem with inability to build
      Python zlib support when libraries are in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu.

   - Switched from PIL to Pillow>=1.7.0, as it has support for the nutty
     natty multiarch paths.

4.0.6.1
    - Adapt to 4.0.6.1; upgrade distribute to 0.6.15.

4.0.5
    - Adapt to Plone 4.0.5

4.0.4 OS X
    - Force static link of readline, zlib to try to cure some reported missing
      lib problems on some systems.

4.0.4
    - Adapt to Plone 4.0.4
    
    - Remove hotfix.

4.0.3 PloneHotfix20110720

    - Add PloneHotfix20110720

4.0.3
    - Use http://dist.plone.org/release/4.0-latest/versions.cfg as commented-
      out reference point.

    - Update to VirtualEnv 1.5.1, Python 2.6.6.

    - Adapt to Plone 4.0.3

    - Pin versions of example products. Fixes #11399.

4.0.2
    - Adapt to Plone 4.0.2

4.0.1
    - Adapt to Plone 4.0.1

    - OpenSolaris compatibility fixes (thanks, nakaji)
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11101

    - Restore distribute to kit installed with python.

4.0
    - Adapt to Plone 4.0.
    
    - Check for Python.h whenever we have a --with-python.

    - Switch to readline 6.1. Remove --disable-shared configure flag from
      readline configure, as it causes it to foul the static build.

    - In zlib 1.2.5 build, if --static is specified, make fails leaving no .h
      file. If --static is not specified, though, static is built and make
      completes.

    - Terminate if no ssl and no w/o ssl option specified.

    - We've had some --with-python installs fail due to inadequate pythons.
      So, we're going to check the virtualenv python after creation.

4.0rc1

    - Adapt to Plone 4.0rc1

    - Change permission/ownership scheme for root installs so that it is
      more easily possible to avoid running buildout as root.

    - Minimize fiddling with the installed python or with the virtualenv
      of the supplied python, hopefully improving flexibility.

    - Check more thoroughly to make sure PLONE_HOME is really created.
      Fixes #9954.

    - Incorporate Products.CMFPlone/Docs into installer and installation.
      Completes #9790 for the Unified Installers.

4.0b5

    - Don't try to build libreadline, libz, libjpeg if system version available
      (except on Darwin for libreadline). Some of this was lost at 4.0b3 when
      we switched to autoconf-style tests.

    - Don't complain and stop for absent ssl headers if a python has been specified.

    - Don't build readline -- even on OS X -- when we already have a python.

    - Install distribute even if setuptools is already present or if virtualenv
      has been used. This makes sure we get a current distribute. Fixes #10703.

    - Backup part should not be included in standalone buildout. Fixes #10664.

    - Separate tests for PIL and JPEG support so that we can give better
      feedback on what's not working.

4.0b4

    - Adapt to 4.0b4

    - Test for JPEG support as well as PIL itself.

    - ZEO user must be set when --user param is used. Fixes #10435.

4.0b3

    - Adapt to 4.0b3.

    - Added develop.cfg.

    - Use autoconf configure style mechanisms to check libraries and paths.

4.0b2

    - Adapt to 4.0b2

    - Quote all sorts of unquoted shell variable uses. Partial fix for
      #10386. Due to some Python library problems, the Unified Installer
      may never be completely space-in-pathname-friendly.

4.0b1-1

    - Adapt to 4.0a4

    - Change strategy for buildout cache to cache eggs for non-binary
      components and packages for binary components.

4.0a5

    - Adapt to 4.0a5

4.0a4

    - Adapt to 4.0a4

    - It doesn't look practical to use different user ids for zeo and
      clients when using shared blobs. Use 'plone' for everything.

    - Fixed bad permissions setting for LC_MESSAGES due to extra slash.

    - Snow Leopard doesn't need CFLAGS="-arch x86_64" to compile on 10.6 64,
      and it prevents compilation on 10.6 32. Removed.

    - Check /usr/lib64 for .so files in checkLib.

    - CFLAGS needs exporting.

4.0a3

    - Adapt to 4.0a3.

4.0a2

    - Adapt to Plone 4.0, Python 2.6.x, Zope 2.1.2, and buildout 1.4.x.
      The biggest changes come from the fact that buildout can now
      cache url extends and has a build from cache directive that allows
      Python packages to be included in buildout/downloads/dist as
      sdist archives rather than as prebuilt eggs. This eliminates
      the need for a precompile of .py files.

      Also, the need to pre-build a Plone site is eliminated by the new
      start page options.

3.3.1

    - Use "-U" flag when running buildout to avoid collisions with
      personal buildout config files.

    - Adapt to 3.3.1

3.3 - installer revision 20090908

    - Improve OS X 10.6 compatibility (a work in progress; there are still

    - Fix pid/lock file names in client2 of zeo config.

3.3rc2

    - Adapt to Plone 3.3rc2

    - Include bootstrap.py in base_skeleton. It may be confusing to some,
      but it's vital if a buildout gets moved.

3.3rc1

    - Adapt to Plone 3.3rc1

3.3b1

    - Adapt to Plone 3.3b1

    - Move Cheetah into egg cache, include non-binary Cheetah.

    - Fixed capitalization errors in init scripts.

3.2.1r3

    - Fixed bug in --instance, did not work with simple name. Added tests.

3.1 ex - testing installer features for Plone 3.2

    - When building Python on Darwin, don't do setpgrp patch if
      MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET is set for Tiger.

    - Switch to a single .py script for instance creation.

    - Create init plone site and content via plonectl (plone.recipe.unifiedinstaller)
      Remove mkPloneSite.py from this kit.

    - Set up root-install cluster to run ZEO and clients under separate
      user ids. Don't allow clients access to filestorage.

    - Unified control program "plonectl"

    - Replace Zope root page with a Plone-specific page

    - Install paster/ZopeSkel under the control of buildout

    - Optional build of readline, mainly needed for Leopard

    - --separate-zope, --skip-tool-tests, --log options, mainly
      useful for building the OS X installer.

    - Heavily commented buildout.cfgs with most major options set
      in variables at the top

    - buildout.cfg with commented out common products

    - Now installs to /usr/local/Plone rather than /opt/Plone-version.
      Uses /Applications/Plone on Darwin.

3.1.4

    - Update to Plone 3.1.4 release.

3.1.3

    - Update to Plone 3.1.3 release.

3.1.2

    - Update to Python 2.4.5, now officially supported by Zope 2.10.6.

    - Update to Plone 3.1.1 release.

    - Add --separate-zope command-line option to build/use
      a Zope outside of the buildout parts.

3.1.1

    - Update to Plone 3.1.1 release.

3.1
    - Update to Plone 3.1 release.

	- Changed the zeo template buildout.cfg clients to use
	  ${zeoserver:zeo-address} rather than literals so that
	  the zeoserver address is only in one spot.

    - Added option to skip running bin/buildout. Use --nobuildout flag.

    - Added documentation on building under OpenBSD.

    - Fixed a bug in the code that tries to find Python.h. This
      would have blocked attempts to build PIL for existing Pythons.

    - Add code to make install.sh work with tar variations that
      don't support bzip2 and/org gunzip. Now requires bunzip2
      and gunzip.

3.1-rc-1

    - Change version numbering to match Plone; advance to 3.1-rc1.

3.1.0-beta1

    - Change version numbering to match Plone; advance to 3.1-beta1.

Beta 5

    - Pin to Plone 3.0.x.

    - If using --with-python and _imaging isn't available, see
      if the headers to build it are available before giving
      up.

    - Set umask to 022 early in install.

    - Add cxx flag to python configure for global libs code branch.

Beta 4

    - Minor change in end-of-install message to accommodate
      splitting of adminPassword.txt in plone.recipes.unifiedinstaller.

    - Make it possible to run install.sh from a separate working directory.

Beta 3

    - Update to Plone 3.0.6, ZopeSkel 1.5.1.

    - Allow target command-line argument to be a relative path
      (thanks, Raphael Ritz).

Beta 2

    - Default to "newest=false" in buildout.cfg.

    - Direct most of build noise to a detailed log file in hopes that
      real errors will get noticed.

Beta 1

    - First major testing release
