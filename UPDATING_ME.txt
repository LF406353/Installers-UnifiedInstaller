Updating the Unified Installer
==============================

This text is for those wishing to build a new version of the Unified Installer.
It is not meant to help update an installed version of Plone.

If you are working from a git clone you will not have the binary packages.
For a good starting point, copy the "packages" subdirectory from a previous installer tarball.

Note that 5.2+ does not have a buildout_cache.
This saves steps from previous installers.

Use a text editor to replace old version with new in all text/documentation files and in:

    helper_scripts/main_install_script.sh
    buildout_templates/buildout.cfg

In buildout.cfg, make sure to update version numbers in both extends and find-links sections.

Do not auto-replace in HISTORY.txt.
Instead, add a new section at the top.

Update the version files:

    cd base_skeleton
    rm *versions.cfg
    ../fetch_versions.py 5.2.x

Note that fetch_versions updates both buildout version files and the requirements.txt.

Look for the most recent update of virtualenv that is thought to be roughly compatible with the new release.
If the copy in ./packages is out-of-date, download the new one to ./packages and remove the old.
Note that setuptools, etc. will be updated based on the requirements.txt file downloaded by fetch_versions.py -- so you don't necessarily need a virtualenv that matches.

Run preliminary sanity-check installs, using both Python 2 (currently the default) and 3:

    rm ~/Plone
    ./install.sh zeo
    ./install.sh standalone

    rm ~/Plone
    ./install.sh --with-python=`which python3` zeo
    ./install.sh --with-python=`which python3` standalone

Make sure these builds succeed.
If they don't, debug.

To run the tests on macOS, use Homebrew (https://brew.sh) to install Python dependencies:

    brew install libxml2 libxslt zlib openssl

Set LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS environment variables so that Python will build correctly from source. Your paths may vary; check the output of your `brew install` commands:

    export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib -L/usr/local/opt/libxslt/lib -L/usr/local/opt/zlib/lib -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
    export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/libxml2/include -I/usr/local/opt/libxslt/include -I/usr/local/opt/zlib/include -I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"

The tests check for a `plonetest` directory in your home directory, e.g. `/home/steve/plonetest`.
Before running the tests, you should create that directory and update the value of `testTarget` in the "Setup stuff" part of "`tests.txt`.

Run the tests:

    cd tests
    python testall.py testout.txt

Read the test results. Fix silly problems. Wash and repeat until clean.

Update the Plone version in buildme.sh, specifically the `BASE_VER` and `INSTALLER_REVISION` variables.

If the `tar` on your system is not from GNU, install GNU tar.
On macOS, use `brew install gnu-tar`.

Update `BASE_VER` and `INSTALLER_REVISION` in `buildme.sh` then build a new installer:

    ./buildme.sh [destination]

where destination is the full path to the working directory to use; defaults to ``~/nobackup/work`.

Upload to Launchpad.
Update release page to link to new installer.

Tag and push.

Testing the installer
---------------------

Configurations:

* standalone
* zeo
* Python 2
* Python 3

on these platforms:

* macOS
* Ubuntu LTS
* Debian
* Windows
* FreeBSD

    ./install.sh --target=/home/bla/Plone-standalone-py2 --with-python=`which python2` standalone

    ./install.sh --target=/home/bla/Plone-zeo-py2 --with-python=`which python2` zeo

    ./install.sh --target=/home/bla/Plone-standalone-py3 --with-python=`which python3` standalone

    ./install.sh --target=/home/bla/Plone-zeo-py3 --with-python=`which python3` zeo
